I'm a dude in his early 40s, with a wife, kid, career, and still unsure of what I want to do when I grow up.

I've always had an interest in computers, electronics, and music.  I don't recall the system, but I do remember copying BASIC from a book to write a Black Jack game on to some 1980s era "computer"  that was hooked to the TV.  The way to save the code was by using a tape deck and audio cassette...which failed, of course.  

In the mid-90s, I'd finally saved up enough to buy my first PC.  A top of the line, Win95 machine with an AMD 486 DX4  120MHz Processor, CD-ROM, and 8MB of RAM.  It was awesome!    Some time later, I managed to convince my parents to let me get "THE INTERNET" (but that meant I had to buy the modem, and get my own phone line, and....)  So of course I did!  I was a high school kid working for just under minimum wage and computers are the future!

By the latter part of the 90s, I ran off to join the military working in communications and electronics.  After my 6 year enlistment was up, I separated and came back to work as a contractor.  Mostly security and CCTV systems, but I still seemed to always have my hands in the computers and electronics.

After working for a few different local companies, I found myself *finally* going to the local community college before my GI Bill expired.  Picked up an associates in "Electronics Engineering Technology".

Side note for anyone unaware of this:  Technology Degrees are NOT engineering degrees.  At least in the eyes of anyone who **REQUIRES** an ABET accredited degree.

These days, I'm working in [[Electromagnetic Compatibility]] as a test technician, dabbling into [[Spectrum Management]], tweaking [[Linux]], and [[listening to music]]
