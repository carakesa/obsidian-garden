Good now,

  You've most likely found my bizarre little spot on the web either from a direct link -- most likely that I supplied -- or your web search has gone horribly awry.

If you're wondering how I, the author, got here, that I can explain a bit more clearly.

I'm horribly disorganized, particularly with schedules.  I started looking for ways to synchronize calendars and notes across systems.  The initial intent was simply to have my Outlook calendar (for work) and Google calendar (personal) in sync.  Forwarding invites from work to private addresses seemed to result in the new addresses being "invitees" and automagically being added to the organizers attendees.

Eww.

Then I started investigating 'self-hosted note apps'.  That led to [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) and the  [Obsidian-Git Plugin]( https://github.com/denolehov/obsidian-git ).  The setup works really well.  My own inexperience with Git and managing what **not** to push to Git has caused a few minor headaches, but all in all it's pretty slick.

A few days ago, I ran across [Everything I Know](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/) and fell in love with the concept.  It's clean, simple, and strips out the crud prevalent in most blogs.  You know the type --  You're looking for the a way to hard boil eggs.  Five minutes later, you have multiple browser tabs open, there's an ad for a VPN, and something suggests using sparkling hotdog water to mitigate the effects of 5g on their coffee table.

I digress, but rest assured there will be more of that in [[ðŸ—‚ Projects/My New Garden/Old_Man_Yells_at_Cloud/Rants_and_Musings\|Old_Man_Yells_at_Cloud/Rants_and_Musings]]
